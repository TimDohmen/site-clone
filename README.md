Using Wireframes and Mock-Ups is common in the developer world, especially when working on a larger team where you will have specific designers making design decisions and developers taking those designs to make a reality. In this challenge students will complete a site based on a template provided to them by the design team.

## Goals
Students will demonstrate an understanding of following a design provided for them, utilizing HTML/CSS and Bootstrap to achieve the appearance of the site designed for them.

## Setup
A good first step is to take the template you have been given, and either open the image in a program such as paint, or draw it out on paper; that way you can better determine the architecture of your document, laying out all the `containers`, `rows`, and `col`umns 

When you are ready to start coding, you will need to create a new application in your command line and create the HTML and CSS files for it. You will also want to grab any external CSS libraries such as bootstrap and include them in your head tag.

>Remember, load order is important. Pay attention to which link tag is where, in order to maintain the proper flows and overrides of your CSS.

## Requirements
 
### Visualization
- [ ] The page utilizes the Bootstrap Grid system to maintain a proper architecture
- [ ] Appropriate use of HTML5 Semantic tags for the `header` and the `footer`
- [ ] The page layout is the same as the mock (content and colors can be changed)
- [ ] On mobile any elements sharing a row should stack (hint: col-12)
